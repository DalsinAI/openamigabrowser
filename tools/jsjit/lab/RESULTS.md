# 68k template JIT: lab results

The AmigaChrome Team. jsc (WebKit pin 54fe1539, patches 0001-0024) cross-built
for m68k Linux with `-m68040`, run under `qemu-m68k -cpu m68040`. The numbers
are 68k instructions executed (`count.sh`), with jsc start-up (6.3 M) taken
off. They are not cycles: a real 68040 also pays for memory and branches.
Every test gives the same result with the JIT on and off.

## 20 Oct 2026, stage T1 (plain templates)

| jsbench test | JIT off (M) | JIT on (M) | change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| int-loop    | 101.8 | 92.7 | -9.0% |
| double-loop |  51.7 | 48.2 | -6.7% |
| calls       |  99.4 | 92.9 | -6.6% |
| properties  | 105.1 | 93.9 | -10.7% |
| closures    |  18.8 | 17.9 | -4.5% |
| array (sort)| 143.9 | 142.8 | -0.7% |
| strings, regexp, json | 9.2, 8.9, 3.6 | same | 0% |

- Only loops are compiled (entry is op_loop_hint); functions without a loop
  (call targets, sort comparators) still run in the interpreter.
- strings, regexp, json and sort spend their time in C++ (string builder,
  Yarr, JSON, the sort), which no JS JIT changes.
- What the templates remove is dispatch and operand decoding. What remains
  is the interpreter's own code: int-loop costs about 460 instructions per
  iteration (8 bytecodes), mostly 64-bit value moves through the register
  file in memory, high-word clears and value profiling. That is the next
  target (DESIGN.md T4, then type-specialised int32 code).
