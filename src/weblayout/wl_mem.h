/*
 * weblayout: one allocator for the whole engine.
 *
 * Every block weblayout holds comes from wl_alloc and goes back through
 * wl_free. Linked into a program (and on the host) that is the C library's
 * malloc and free. Built as weblayout.library (WL_EXEC_POOLS) it is an Exec
 * memory pool per document, so the library never needs a caller's C
 * library, and disposing of a document gives back anything still in its
 * pool. A NULL pool is allowed: such blocks come from AllocVec (library) or
 * malloc (linked).
