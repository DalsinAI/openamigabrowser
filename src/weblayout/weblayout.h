/*
 * weblayout: a web page laid out and drawn into a RastPort.
 *
 * The public face of OpenBrowser Lite's page engine: HTML Lite (the
 * semantic HTML adapter), CSS Lite (the small cascade), OpenLayout (the
 * geometry and the display list) and page pictures through
 * picture.datatype. OpenBrowser Lite calls nothing else of the engine.
 *
 * It is shaped as a library (docs/WEBLAYOUT_LIBRARY.md): opaque documents,
 * Exec types, no callbacks, no varargs and no C library types in the calls,
 * and structures that carry their own size. It is linked into a program,
 * or opened as LIBS:weblayout.library 1, whose vectors are these calls
 * (src/weblayout/library: weblayout_lib.sfd, and <proto/weblayout.h> from
 * it). A program using the library includes <proto/weblayout.h> after this
 * header and opens WebLayoutBase before WL_Open.
 *
 * A page, step by step:
 *
 *   doc = WL_NewDocument(bytes, length, WLKIND_HTML, "https://host/page");
 *   for each WLRES_STYLESHEET: fetch it, WL_AddStyleSheet(doc, css, len)
 *   WL_Layout(doc, &view)                       (width, font, RastPort)
 *   for each WLRES_IMAGE: fetch it to a file, WL_SetImageFile(doc, ...)
 *   WL_Draw(doc, &view)                         (again after scrolling)
 *   url = WL_HitLink(doc, &view, mouse_x, mouse_y)
 *   WL_DisposeDocument(doc)
 *
 * Fetching is the caller's: weblayout never opens a socket or a file
 * except the picture files it is handed.
