/*
 * webbrowser.library: web pages for any Amiga program. URL in, a page
 * ready to use out: its picture (32-bit pixels, or drawn into a RastPort),
 * its text and title.
 *
 *   struct Library *WebBrowserBase = OpenLibrary("webbrowser.library", 1);
 *   APTR view = WB_OpenView(640, 480, NULL);
 *   WB_Load(view, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/");
 *   WB_WaitLoaded(view, 120);                    seconds at most
 *   WB_RenderRastPort(view, window->RPort, 0, 0, 0, 0, 640, 480);
 *   WB_CloseView(view);
 *   CloseLibrary(WebBrowserBase);
 *
 * One engine serves every program. The library starts it the first time it
 * is opened (LIBS:WebBrowser/WebBrowserEngine) and keeps it in memory after
 * the last program closes the library, so later programs find it ready;
 * WB_Shutdown() ends it. Calls are synchronous and may come from any task.
 *
 * WB_OpenBrowser(url, tags) opens OpenBrowser's own window in the engine
 * (or shows the page in it when it is already open): the OpenBrowser icon
 * does just that, so the browser opens at once while the engine is in
 * memory.
