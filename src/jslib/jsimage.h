/*
 * jsimage: a program that takes JavaScriptCore, WTF and bmalloc from
 * JavaScriptEngine's code instead of linking its own copy
 * (scripts/jsimage.py says how it is linked).
 *
 * The client's first code is jsimage_entry (jsimage_client.c): it loads
 * JavaScriptEngine, checks that it is the build the client was linked
 * against, makes the client's references to it point at where it was
 * loaded, and runs it. JavaScriptEngine's main (jsl_engine.c) sees
 * jsimage_client set and runs the client's own start-up in the same
 * process (jsimage_host.c), so both C run-times are set up, and every
 * global, the allocator and the C library's state the two share are the
 * image's.
