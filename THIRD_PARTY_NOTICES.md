# Third-party notices

OpenBrowser's own code is MIT (see LICENSE). These parts are not ours and keep
their own licences:

| Path | What | Licence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `webkit/patches/` | Changes to WebKit / JavaScriptCore source files | The licence of each patched file: LGPL-2 or BSD-style, as stated in its header in WebKit (https://github.com/WebKit/WebKit) |
| `icu/patches/` | Changes to ICU 78.3 source files | Unicode License v3 (ICU) |
| `stove/gcc-patches/` | Changes to GCC 16 (bebbo amiga-gcc, branch amiga16.2) and its newlib headers | GPL-3.0-or-later with the GCC Runtime Library Exception (GCC); newlib's own licence for `sys-include` |

Patch 0019 (`webkit/patches/0019-jsc-generators-in-python.patch`) adds Python
ports of WebKit's Ruby build scripts so that JavaScriptCore builds without
Ruby: `Source/JavaScriptCore/offlineasm-py/` (offlineasm's front end, from
`offlineasm/*.rb`), `Source/JavaScriptCore/generator-py/` (the bytecode
generator, from `generator/*.rb`) and `Source/WTF/Scripts/GeneratePreferences.py`
(from `GeneratePreferences.rb`). They are derived works of Apple Inc.'s
BSD-licensed originals (Copyright (C) 2011-2023 Apple Inc.): each file keeps
Apple's copyright notice and licence text, with a line for the AmigaChrome
Team's port, and stays under that BSD licence. The M68K back end
(`offlineasm-py/offlineasm/m68k.py`, a port of our own `m68k.rb`), the
BytecodeList reader (`generator-py/RubyListReader.py`) and `Source/cmake/no-ruby.py`
are ours (MIT, AmigaChrome Team).

Patch 0021 (`webkit/patches/0021-webcore-generators-in-python.patch`) does the
same for WebCore: `Source/WebCore/domjit/generate-abstract-heap.py`,
`Source/WebCore/Scripts/GenerateSettings.py` and
`Source/WebCore/Scripts/GenerateQuirkBehaviors.py`, ports of Apple Inc.'s
BSD-licensed Ruby scripts (Copyright (C) 2016-2023 Apple Inc.), and the
Python forms of their templates (`*.pyerb`, from Apple's `*.erb`). They keep
Apple's notices and licence, with a line for the AmigaChrome Team's port.

`third_party/openmail/` comes from OpenMail (AmigaChrome Team's mail client,
MIT, same copyright); see its `FROM` and `LICENSE`.

OpenBrowser Lite links, at build time, libnix and libamiga from bebbo's
amiga-gcc and uses OpenTLS (opentls.library) when it runs; until 19 October
2026 it used AmiSSL 5 (OpenSSL 3, Apache-2.0).

Built programs also link, at build time on your machine (none of it is in this
repository):

- WebKit's WTF, bmalloc and JavaScriptCore (LGPL-2 / BSD);
- ICU 78.3 (Unicode License v3);
- libnix and libpthread from bebbo's amiga-gcc (libnix: public domain/its own
  terms; libpthread by Szilard Biro: zlib-style);
- libstdc++, libgcc and libatomic (GPL-3.0 with the GCC Runtime Library Exception).

A `jsc` binary built from this repository is a combined work that includes
LGPL-licensed JavaScriptCore; distribute it under the LGPL's terms (source and
relinking information available). JavaScriptCore stays a separate program; it
is not part of AmigaChrome's own core.
