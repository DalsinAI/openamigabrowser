"""jsimage: link a program against JavaScriptEngine's code instead of its
own copy of JavaScriptCore, WTF and bmalloc.

JavaScriptEngine (src/jslib, built with the browser) is one pc-relative
hunk holding JavaScriptCore, WTF, bmalloc, ICU and the C and C++ run-time
they use. A client (the browser's engine) is linked with each name it
takes from the image set to __jsimage_base, the end of its own hunk, plus
the name's offset in the image. Its first code (src/jslib/
jsimage_client.c) loads the image, adds I - B - __jsimage_base to every
such reference (I the image's address, B the client's), and runs the
image, whose main runs the client's own start-up in the same process.
scripts/build-webcore.sh's "jsimage" command runs these steps.
